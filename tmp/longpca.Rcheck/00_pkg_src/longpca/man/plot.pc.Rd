\arguments{
\item{pcs}{}

\description{
This creates five diagnostic plots:
\enumerate{
\item Screeplot: The top \code{k} singular values of \code{L}.
\item Better screeplot: its singular values \code{2:k} (because the first one is usually dominant and difficult to see an elbow past it).
\item A "localization plot" which is very similar (maybe exact?) to \href{https://github.com/karlrohe/LocalizationDiagnostic}{this stuff}; for each row (and column) compute its degree and its leverage score.  Take the log of both. Fit a linear model \code{log(leverage)~log(degree)} and plot the residuals against \code{log(degree)}.  If there is localization, I suspect that there will be a big curl on the right side.
\item Pairs plot of \code{row_features}. This is the plot emphasized in the varimax paper. In these example plots below, we do not see very clear radial streaks.
\item A pairs plot for \code{column_features}.  In both pairs plots, if there are more than 1000 points, then the code samples 1000 points with probability proportional to their leverage scores.  It will plot up to \code{k=10} dimensions.  If \code{k} is larger, then it plots the first 5 and the last 5.
