add_graph_summaries     graph_summaries this function takes an
                        interaction_model and an interaction_model,
                        where row_universe and column_universe have two
                        additional columns $coreness and
                        $component_label. importantly, strange behavior
                        if im is a symmetric graph. this treats each
                        row index and each column index as nodes in a
                        graph.  So, if something appears in both rows
                        and columns (e.g. as in symmetric graph), then
                        this will be ignored.
clean                   clean Given and interaction_model, this returns
                        a new interaction_model that is the "k-core" of
                        the "largest connected component" of the
                        original interaction_model.  This function is
                        recommended when 'diagnose(im)' shows that the
                        majority of rows/columns have 1, 2, or 3
                        connections.  In this case, the data is
                        potentially too sparse for pca. If you simply
                        throwing away the rows/columns that are weakly
                        connected, then you will reduce the connections
                        of those that remain.  The k-core is what you
                        get if you keep on iterating.  In particular,
                        it will find the largest subset of rows and
                        columns from the interaction_model such that
                        every row and column has at least
                        'core_threshold' number of connections or "data
                        points" in interaction_tibble.  This is exactly
                        the k-core if the row and columns correspond to
                        unique elements (non-overlapping).  If the
                        elements in the rows match some elements in the
                        columns, then those elements are represented
                        twice... once for the row and once for the
                        column.  It is possible that only one of those
                        is retained.
core                    core Given an interaction_model, this will
                        return another interaction_model that
                        corresponds to the "k-core" of the input.  This
                        function is recommended when 'diagnose(im)'
                        shows that the majority of rows/columns have 1,
                        2, or 3 connections.  In this case, the data is
                        potentially too sparse for pca.  If you simply
                        throwing away the rows/columns that are weakly
                        connected, then you will reduce the connections
                        of those that remain.  The k-core is what you
                        get if you keep on iterating.  In particular,
                        it will find the largest subset of rows and
                        columns from the interaction_model such that
                        every row and column has at least
                        'core_threshold' number of connections or "data
                        points" in interaction_tibble.  This is exactly
                        the k-core if the row and columns correspond to
                        unique elements (non-overlapping).  If the
                        elements in the rows match some elements in the
                        columns, then those elements are represented
                        twice... once for the row and once for the
                        column.  It is possible that only one of those
                        is retained.
